# BIOL3100 Exams

I will push exams to this repository when it's time. You will need to clone/pull this repo to get all the exam files and instructions.
Exams will each be in their own directory with a README file that details your tasks and the grading breakdown.

### You will submit exams by pushing them to *your* GitHub repo. Make sure that all file paths are relative, that you use an R-Project, and that any files with naming instructions are named accurately.
